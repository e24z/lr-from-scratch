# Linear Regression From Scratch

In this project, I will loosely apply some of the techniques described in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmbA0pi2cRQ) to this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/advertising-sales-dataset).

My main goal is to gain a fundamental understanding of the process behind linear regression. 

I currently understand the process to be composed of two distinct operations:
- Defining a loss function
- Defining a gradient descent function which utilises the previous function.


## Goals:

-   Implement Linear Regression from scratch,
-   Familarise myself with the Python development workflow,
-   Generate predictions with the model that I create,
-   State the uncertainty of each of my model's predictions.
