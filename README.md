# Linear Regression From Scratch

In this project, I will apply the techniques in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxkzRL0LavU) to this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/advertising-sales-dataset).

## Goals:

-   Implement Linear Regression from scratch,
-   Familarise myself with the Python development workflow,
-   Generate predictions with the model that I create,
-   State the uncertainty of each of my model's predictions.
